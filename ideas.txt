ideas for where im going:
- add a custom link tag - will *attempt* to parse html from any webpage you pass it and return its summary
- add a custom model tag - will deploy different models apart from the default we're using here
- move to_json to rust, see if we can move model deployment to rust as well


-cd
    - linting, formatting
    - context of a bash script -> put to separate environment
    - put in efs?
        - invoke from lambda? timer instead of event 
    - cloudbuild


- fix delete resources
    - when codespace ended and i came back a few hours later, resources were still running but delete resources errored out
